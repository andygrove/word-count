# word-count

Counting words in different languages. This is my playground for learning new languages by finding the top N occurring words over a given length L in the complete works of shakespeare and for comparing performance of different languages, frameworks, and approaches.

The correct results for words of minimum length 6 are:

```
should=173800
father=118360
exeunt=113850
master=92840
before=92290
prince=84920
cannot=83820
heaven=71940
brother=70950
nothing=69960
```
